# Batch Orchestration Patterns for GenAI APIs

Production patterns for cost-effective, reliable AI workloads.

## The Problem
Naive LLM API usage is expensive and slow:
- Sequential processing: 10 documents × 2s = 20 seconds
- No error handling: one failure kills the batch
- Unoptimized costs: $0.50/request × 1000 = $500

## This Solution
Demonstrates batching patterns that reduce costs by 60-80%:
- Parallel processing with concurrency control
- Graceful degradation and partial success handling [upcoming]
- Bulk database operations
- Smart retry strategies [upcoming]

## Patterns Implemented
✅ Batch preparation and validation
✅ Concurrent API calls with rate limiting
✅ Partial failure handling [upcoming]
✅ Bulk database writes
✅ Cost tracking and optimization [upcoming]
